# Striver's SDE Sheet Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the problems from **Striver's SDE Sheet** - a curated list of top coding interview problems for software development engineering (SDE) roles. These problems are specifically designed to enhance your data structures and algorithms (DSA) skills, which are crucial for acing coding interviews.

By maintaining this repository, I aim to showcase my proficiency in DSA and demonstrate my dedication to preparing for coding interviews. It serves as a testament to my problem-solving abilities and highlights my commitment to continuous learning and improvement.

## Sheet Contents

The Striver's SDE Sheet consists of a comprehensive collection of coding interview problems covering various topics, including arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more. Each problem is handpicked to challenge your understanding of fundamental concepts and help you develop efficient and optimized solutions.

The repository is organized into folders, with each folder representing a specific topic or category. Within each folder, you will find individual problem solutions in the form of source code files.

## Usage

You can navigate through the repository to explore the solutions to specific problems. Each source code file is named after the problem it solves, making it easy to locate and review the solutions.

You can explore the solutions, understand the thought process behind them, and then go over the code implementation. You can use them as a reference to enhance your problem-solving skills and gain insights into different approaches.

## Acknowledgments

I want to thank Striver (Aditya Verma) for creating and sharing Striver's SDE Sheet. His valuable resources have greatly contributed to my understanding of data structures, algorithms, and coding interview preparation.
